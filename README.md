# **📌 Running Jupyter Notebook in a Folder (Windows Terminal)**  

## **1️⃣ Open the Terminal & Navigate to Your Folder**  

1. **Open Command Prompt (CMD) or Windows PowerShell:**  
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter`  
   - Or, press `Win + X` and select `Windows PowerShell`  

2. **Change Directory to Your Project Folder**  
   - Use `cd` to navigate to the folder containing your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file).  
   - Example: If your project is in `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\TradeReconciliation`, run:  
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\TradeReconciliation
     ```
   - You can also **drag and drop** the folder into the terminal after typing `cd ` (with a space).  

---

## **2️⃣ Start Jupyter Notebook in the Current Folder**  

Once you're inside the correct folder, start Jupyter Notebook by running:  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
✅ This will **open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser**.

If Jupyter is not installed, install it first using:  
```bash
pip install notebook
```

## **Open Your Notebook & Run Cells**  

### **🔹 Step 1: Open Your Notebook**
- In the browser, navigate to your **`.ipynb`** file (e.g., `assessment.ipynb`)  
- Click on the file to open it.  

steps -> to the folder(project)  in the terminal , and type : jupyter notebook (first install it ,if not present)

**click on the assessment.ipynb file**
**and run all**


## **🚀 Next Steps**  
Now that Jupyter is running:  
✅ Load trade data and execute reconciliation.  
✅ Store results in **DuckDB (`trades.db`)**.  
✅ Export reports for analysis.
